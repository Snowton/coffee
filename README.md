## Details

All of the site's source code is freely available for use. Note that all paths beginning with /cjlh will go to our CJLH home page. If you wish to only take the blogging portion of the site, I might make a separate repo with just that, but all you have to do is remove the /cjlh routes in app.js, as well as the /cjlh views and public files (this is not necessary, but it will reduce clutter). They are not too hard to pick out, but if you have trouble feel free to contact me.
