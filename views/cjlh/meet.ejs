    <p>
        The contest is comprised of 40 questions to be completed in 75 minutes. The questions are divided into ten Rounds of 4 questions each. Contestants will only work on one Round at a time. Once a Round is submitted, contests may not change their answers for that Round, but they will gain access to the next Round (unless they are at Round 10, in which case they will have finished the contest).
    </p>
    <p>
        The contest will be hosted on Zoom, and the problems will be provided on PDFs. Submissions will be through Google Forms.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Contestants may use paper and writing utensils, such as pencils, pens, and erasers. No calculators, compasses, protractors, rulers, or other external resources are allowed.
